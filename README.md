# prob_model_sampling
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation and results of a probabilistic model.
Since this model has two continuous latent variables, multiple quantities can be inferred by bayesian inference and 
marginalization.

For basic usage and more functionality demonstration have a look at the 
[jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jgwiese/prob_model_sampling/blob/main/learning.ipynb).
